# prepare_system.sh — Helper script to configure the host OS for optimal AFL++ performance
# Performs the same steps as documented in README (System Preparation for Testing)
# 1) Sets /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern to "core" so AFL++ can obtain core dumps.
# 2) Forces all CPU frequency governors to "performance" to reduce fuzzing jitter.
#
# Usage:
#   sudo ./scripts/prepare_system.sh
#
# The script will attempt to re-execute itself under sudo if not already root.
# For Linux only.
set -euo pipefail

# Re-exec with sudo if not root

    echo "[prepare_system] This script must run as root. Attempting to use sudo…"
    exec sudo "$0" "$@"
